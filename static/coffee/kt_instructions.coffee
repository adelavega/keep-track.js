In this task, you'll see one word at a time from various categories.<br><br>
Your job will be to remember the last word from some of those categories. <br><br>

Let's see how it works!"

"The words you'll see belong to six categories.<br>
Take a second to familiarize yourself with them. "

"You'll be told which categories to pay attention to before you see any words. The categories will stay on the screen, so don't worry about memorizing them. <br><br>
For example, you may be asked to keep track of only words that are <strong>animals</strong>.<br><br>

In this case, you'll want to ignore words from other categories, like <i>countries<i> or <i>metals</i>."

"
Above the categories you'll see one word at a time for two seconds each.<br><br>
For example, you might see the word 'Tiger' followed by 'Yard' and then 'Horse'. <br><br>
If you were asked to keep track of <strong>animals</strong>, the correct answer would be 'Horse', because it was the last animal word we showed you."

"Let's see a short example!<br><br>

You'll see six words in a row.<br><br>	

Keep track <i>in your head</i> words that are <strong>animals</strong>. <br><br>
Ignore words from other categories.<br><br>"

"The last Animal word was 'Cat'.  <br><br>
Is that what you saw?<br><br> If you are confused watch that again, otherwise let's learn how to input your responses."

"You'll see a grid with all of the possible words in the categories you were asked to keep track of, like this:<br><br><br><br><br>

To respond, just click on the word you thought was the last of each category. "

"Try entering, 'Cat', the correct answer of the example"

"Good job.
<br><br>Let's do a longer example, this time with two categories.<br><br>
Remember to pay attention to the categories and only keep track of the <i>last</i> 
item from each category"

"Great! You're done with the practice. <br><br>
We're now going to show you 8 more lists.<br>When you enter the answer for one trial, the next one will begin immediately after. <br><br>
You will be asked to keep track of 3, 4 or 5 categories.<br><br> Pay a lot of attention, this task can get really hard, especially with 5 categories. <br>
